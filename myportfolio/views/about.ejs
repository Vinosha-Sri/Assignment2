                <h2>Networking and IT Security Student</h2>                
                <p>Hello! My name is Vinosha Srikugananthan, and I am passionate about technology, security, and making an impact in the tech community. As a third-year university student at Ontario Tech University, I am currently specializing in Networking and IT Security while pursuing a minor in Business Management. My involvement in various leadership roles, such as the Vice President of Information Technology at the Business and Information Technology Society (BITSoc), and Vice President of the Technology Management Student Association (TMSA), has helped me develop strong problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills. I am eager to continue learning and growing in the field, while also giving back to the student community.</p>
